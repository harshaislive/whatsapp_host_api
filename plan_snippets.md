Okay, let's plan how to build the "Snippets" application on top of the existing WhatsApp API server. This involves modifying the backend to capture incoming messages and store them, setting up Supabase, and building a new frontend application to display the snippets.

Here's a thorough plan without making any code changes yet:

**Phase 1: Backend Modifications (WhatsApp API Server)**

1.  **Listen for Incoming Messages:**
    *   Modify the `whatsapp.service.ts` (or create a dedicated handler).
    *   Use the Baileys library's event listener (likely `sock.ev.on('messages.upsert', ...)` or similar) to capture incoming messages. This event usually fires when a new message is received or updated.
2.  **Process Incoming Messages:**
    *   Inside the event handler, parse the incoming message data provided by Baileys.
    *   Extract key information:
        *   `senderJid`: The WhatsApp ID of the sender (e.g., `1234567890@s.whatsapp.net`).
        *   `messageTimestamp`: The time the message was sent.
        *   `messageType`: Determine if it's text, image, video, document, etc.
        *   `messageContent`:
            *   For text messages: Extract the text content.
            *   For media (image, video): Identify that it's media. We'll need to download it later.
3.  **Integrate Supabase Client:**
    *   Add the Supabase JavaScript client library (`@supabase/supabase-js`) as a dependency to the backend project (`npm install @supabase/supabase-js`).
    *   Configure the Supabase client within the backend application, likely in a config file or service. This will require your Supabase Project URL and a Service Role Key (keep this secure, e.g., in `.env`).
4.  **Download Media:**
    *   For incoming media messages, use Baileys functions (like `downloadMediaMessage`) to download the image or video content into a buffer or temporary file.
5.  **Upload Media to Supabase Storage:**
    *   Use the configured Supabase client to upload the downloaded media buffer/file to a designated Supabase Storage bucket (e.g., `whatsapp-media`).
    *   Get the public or signed URL of the uploaded media from Supabase Storage.
6.  **Save Message Data to Supabase Database:**
    *   Use the Supabase client to insert a new record into a Supabase table (e.g., `whatsapp_snippets`).
    *   The record should contain:
        *   `sender_jid`
        *   `timestamp`
        *   `message_type` ('text', 'image', 'video')
        *   `content` (either the text message or the Supabase Storage URL for media)
        *   Any other relevant metadata (e.g., `message_id`).
7.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for message processing, media download/upload, and database insertion.

**Phase 2: Supabase Setup**

1.  **Create Supabase Project:** If you haven't already, create a new project on [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/).
2.  **Database Table:**
    *   Create a new table named `whatsapp_snippets` (or similar).
    *   Define columns:
        *   `id` (uuid, primary key, auto-generated)
        *   `created_at` (timestamp with timezone, default now())
        *   `sender_jid` (text, not null)
        *   `timestamp` (timestamp with timezone, not null)
        *   `message_type` (text, e.g., 'text', 'image', 'video', not null)
        *   `content` (text, not null) - Stores text message or media URL.
        *   *(Optional)* `sender_name` (text) - Could be populated later or derived.
        *   *(Optional)* `raw_message` (jsonb) - Store the raw Baileys message object for debugging/future use.
    *   Consider adding indexes on `timestamp` and `sender_jid` for faster querying.
3.  **Storage Bucket:**
    *   Create a new Storage bucket named `whatsapp-media` (or similar).
    *   Configure access policies. For simplicity initially, you could make it public, but for better security, consider using signed URLs generated by the backend or frontend based on user authentication (though authentication isn't specified yet).
4.  **API Keys:** Note down your Supabase Project URL, `anon` key (for the frontend), and `service_role` key (for the backend - keep this secret!).

**Phase 3: Frontend Application (New Project)**

1.  **Choose Framework:** Select a frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc.) or use plain HTML/CSS/JS.
2.  **Project Setup:** Create a new frontend project repository/directory.
3.  **Install Supabase Client:** Add the Supabase JavaScript client library (`@supabase/supabase-js`) to the frontend project (`npm install @supabase/supabase-js`).
4.  **Configure Supabase Client:** Initialize the Supabase client in your frontend code using the Project URL and the `anon` key.
5.  **Fetch Snippets:**
    *   Implement logic to query the `whatsapp_snippets` table from Supabase using the client library.
    *   Fetch snippets, likely ordering them by `timestamp` (descending for newest first).
6.  **Filtering:**
    *   Add UI elements (date pickers, dropdowns) for date range filtering.
    *   Modify the Supabase query based on the selected filters (e.g., using `.gte()` and `.lte()` on the `timestamp` column).
7.  **Display Snippets:**
    *   Create a "Snippet Card" UI component.
    *   This component should display:
        *   Sender (`sender_jid` - could be enhanced later)
        *   Timestamp (formatted nicely)
        *   Message Content:
            *   If `message_type` is 'text', display the `content`.
            *   If `message_type` is 'image' or 'video', use the `content` (which is the Supabase Storage URL) as the `src` for an `<img>` or `<video>` tag.
8.  **UI Structure:** Arrange the filter controls and the list of snippet cards in the main application view. Handle loading states while fetching data.

**Phase 4: Considerations & Enhancements**

1.  **Security:**
    *   Keep the Supabase `service_role` key secure in the backend (`.env` file, environment variables).
    *   Review Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) if you need fine-grained access control later, especially if multiple users interact with the frontend.
    *   Secure the media bucket appropriately (public vs. signed URLs).
2.  **Real-time Updates:** Use Supabase Realtime Subscriptions on the frontend to listen for new inserts into the `whatsapp_snippets` table and automatically update the UI without requiring a page refresh.
3.  **Sender Names:** The `sender_jid` isn't very user-friendly. You might need a way to map JIDs to contact names (this can be complex, potentially requiring access to phone contacts or manual mapping).
4.  **Scalability:** Consider database indexing and potential pagination on the frontend if you expect a very large number of snippets.
5.  **Deployment:** Plan deployment for both the modified backend server and the new frontend application.

This plan covers the major steps needed to build your "Snippets" application. Does this align with your vision? We can refine any part of this plan before proceeding.
